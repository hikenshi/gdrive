Thanks TA40

Since using this tool, and compiling from source above, I have noticed a couple issues.
1. tool is pretty useful for uploading compiled binaries to my google drive developer account
2. not being maintained
3. lots of contributions including this tutorial on installing for your own API needed for tool to be effective
4. I am willing to maintain it. 

summary of issues below without pictures, copy and pasted from above issue

thanks tripLr

Notes, : if you are compiling this tool, you are using a developer API from someone else, and may/will get errors
This tutorial will help you compile for your platform README.md is unchanged, other than pointing to this tutorial

### How to get rid of 403 errors

Many people get Errors like
`Failed to get file: googleapi: Error 403: Rate Limit Exceeded, rateLimitExceeded`
and thanks to LINKIWI [#392 (comment)](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/392#issuecomment-423048518) I found a way to fix it properly.
#### What causes the problem?

The developer made one API for this program and an Google API can "only" make 10 million requests at a day. That means that too many people use this program and the requests gets full.
#### How much does an own API cost?

Nothing, Google made them free for everyone.
#### How do I fix it then?

You have to make an own API, download the programing language go, change the API to your own one and compile it to an .exe.
(And btw. binary editing resulted in errors)
#### Linux install instructions 
#### And now step by step: (Windows users ?)


    1. Download "go" for windows from https://golang.org/dl/ and install it with standard settings and download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it with standard settings

    2. Download the repository as .zip from GitHub and unzip it in a new folder
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983299-9a11d680-2498-11e9-81d3-fa6f6e8ddd86.png)

    3. Log into your Google Account (or create one) and go to the [Google Developer API Website](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) (and if needed accept the ToS)

    4. Click on "Create Project"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983494-14425b00-2499-11e9-83bd-372b88bcda37.png)

    5. and then click "CREATE"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983553-3e941880-2499-11e9-9e15-cb40db9e5d4f.png)

    6. Give it a name (in my case "Google CLI TA40") and click "Create"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983662-93d02a00-2499-11e9-91b6-b50ed28e4943.png)

    7. Now go to [Google Drive API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com) and click "ENABLE"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983741-cbd76d00-2499-11e9-9adb-01a742f6f2ed.png)

    8. Now on the left side, click "Credentials"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983847-0b9e5480-249a-11e9-8a55-48f1f93e4193.png)

    9. And click "CREATE CREDENTIAL"
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983896-338db800-249a-11e9-92df-5bcf779942dd.png)

    10. Fill the things like I did and then click on "What credentials do I need?"
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983961-66d04700-249a-11e9-9039-d9d15025e31f.png)

    11. Give it a name (I took the name of the API)
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51983993-86676f80-249a-11e9-85de-5e3eccd0122d.png)

    12. Next select your e-mail and then give it a name (I again took the name of the API)
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51984095-c62e5700-249a-11e9-9cc4-b8e6986b2dfd.png)

    13. Click on "Download" (A .json file will be downloaded)
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51984163-f4ac3200-249a-11e9-914a-956b956fc51d.png)

    14. Open the .json file in the editor of your choice.(Notepad++ prefered)
        You should see :


    * "client_id" which looks like this: `81915486XXXX-XXXX22bh62ql2rbnaqtpds82od4ql976.apps.googleusercontent.com`

    * "client_secret" which are random characters like this: `lnA7ZFg5NEGOMpFhd6e4Pqny`


    1. In the unzipped repository open the file names "handlers_drive.go" (via Notepad++) and change these 2 variables to the ones you got in step 14
       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46388493/51984552-f0ccdf80-249b-11e9-9cd3-af6d7550f3e4.png)
       and save it

    2. open CMD and go to the folder where the "handerls_drive.go" is.
       First type this: `go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive` (thanks to mbenlioglu [#426 (comment)](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/426#issuecomment-459046466))
       Now type this: `go build`
       Now you should have an .exe which you can use normally


You can reset your data by deleting the .gdrive Folder in %appdata%
#### Compiling an Linux/OS X/etc. version of gdrive in Windows:

Look up your OS here: https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment
Now do this in cmd:
`SET GOOS=your os`
`SET GOARCH=your arch`
then do `go build`

EXAMPLE:
`SET GOOS=linux`
`SET GOARCH=amd64`

Hopefully anyone can translate step 16 (compiling) in linux and/or MacOS, thanks
